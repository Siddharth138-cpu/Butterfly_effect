# Lorenz Attractor - Animated Visualization

An animated visualization of the Lorenz Attractor, demonstrating deterministic chaos and the butterfly effect in a 3D plot.

---

## Overview

This Python script animates the Lorenz Attractor system, a classic example of chaos theory where small changes in initial conditions produce vastly different outcomes—illustrating the famous "butterfly effect." The attractor's trajectory never repeats exactly but remains bounded within a strange attractor resembling a butterfly shape.

Developed with classic Lorenz system parameters (\(\sigma=10\), \(\rho=28\), \(\beta=\frac{8}{3}\)) using numerical integration and matplotlib's 3D plotting and animation capabilities.
